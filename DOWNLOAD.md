# Downloading Data

This document describes how to download the raw underlying files.

## Setup

Every data item has its own index. If we instruct everyone to use the `infos` dataframes
and that forces a particular structure on how it's downloaded / named, then the
loading / "predicting paths" should be easy.

## Install dependencies

```
export ROOT_DATA_PATH=/path/to/ml-data/data

img2dataset
yt-dlp
datasets (from transformers)
```
